    "## Course Expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Rule\n",
    "#1 Rule Respect: \n",
    "\n",
    "Students in the course shall respect other students taking this course. Everyone comes from different backgrounds - including technical. This means everyone has different experience. Questions are encouraged, and I will not tolerate scoffing, laughing, snickering, or any form of disrespect when questions are asked. \n",
    "\n",
    "The classroom is a place of learning, both for you and for me. Learning can be vulnerable - to admit you do not know something or admit you taught/learned something wrong - can make you feel vulnerable. I hope my class is a space where you can feel vulnerable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Homeworks/Labs and Project\n",
    "\n",
    "This course will have no test or graded quizzes. The course will have homeworks and a final project. The final project will be worked on throughout the semester. Ideally from the first day of the course until the end. \n",
    "\n",
    "A report will be due on your project, I am still determining what will be necessary to submit for your final project. This may be up for discussion through the semester based on your feedback. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Having Fun!\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this course to have a bit of fun with it. If you do not need this course for a grade, I encourage you to take it pass/fail. This will hopefully de-stress the experience and make the learning process a bit more fun. However - I do not expect to grade harshly. With reasonable effort you will do well in this course. Ideally I want you to walk away from this course wanting to do more - not feel burnt out or overwhelmed. It will be a bit of balancing for me in this first semester.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be available over email! I work in industry, so I will most likely be checking this at the end of the day. I aim to get back to you within 48 hours. My updates will come over email, as opposed to moodle. \n",
    "\n",
    "I encourage you as a class to make a discord/slack/google-chat channel to discuss coursework outside of traditional means. We need to decide what chat we are using for the class. This tends to be quicker than email.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Please ask me questions! Having someone to ask questions is the main benefit of taking a course like this one as opposed to learning through youtube or articles. Its okay to ask the same question again or even 3 times! I want to make sure you have a solid understanding and you feel your question was answered well."

    "## What this course is not\n",
    "\n",
    "With this course being a 1 credit hour course and the course title - Exploring Machine Learning we will not be deep diving into every ML algorithm. My goal is to give you a fundamentals understanding of machine learning techniques and the application of models. We will dive deeper into the math for some models, but I will not expect you to regurgitate any derivations. Granted I will try to provide additional resources for those who want to dig deeper into these models.\n",

    "1. Recognizing data as information – not truth – with error, variability, and degrees of inclusion/exclusion,\n",
    "6. Assessing validity of data, methods, results, and communication,\n",

    "\n",
    "We will be using Jupyter Notebooks throughout the course. I will be using them in VSCode, that is the text editor I recommend. You may use what text editor or Notebook manager you like to use, but it may take some work to get all the graphs/code running. - If you have some trouble with this please let me know and I can help try to get it setup for your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homeworks will be completed in Jupyter Notebooks, and submitted using Git onto Github. More in the next section. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use Jupyter Notebooks since they allow us to run \"snippets\" of python code. This is beneficial since it allows us to run snippets that take a long time once, and code we would like to experiment multiple times. Variables are shared globally in the notebook (like a script) unless they are scoped in a function, or are the member of an object.\n"
